# Uber-fare-prediction-model

This repository contains code for a machine learning model to predict Uber fares based on various features. The model is trained on a dataset of historical Uber rides and aims to provide accurate fare estimates for future rides.

# Overview
Aim of this project to accurately predict the fare price for uber ride based on features like Distance travel, Start point, Destination, Day of week etc.
We are using Random Forest regression model to predict the fare amount.

# Features used to train the model
‘pickup
longitude'
,
’pickup latitude'
,
'dropoff longitude'
,
'dropoff latitude'
,
'hour'
,
'month'
,
'year'
,
'day of the week'
,
'distance travel (km)'.

# Getting Started
